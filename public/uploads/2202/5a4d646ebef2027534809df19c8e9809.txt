This is a CONNECT tunnel, through which encrypted HTTPS traffic flows.
Fiddler's HTTPS Decryption feature is enabled, but this specific tunnel was configured not to be decrypted.  Session Flag 'X-No-Decrypt' was set to: 'PeekYieldedUnknownProtocol'.

A SSLv2-compatible ServerHello handshake was found. In v2, the ~client~ selects the active cipher after the ServerHello, when sending the Client-Master-Key message. Fiddler only parses the handshake.
